# Vim Hacktorial 

This is a hacktorial to show people whom are curious about vim, what its about, why to use it, and why its better than `<insert favorite editor>`. This is not meant for people with a strong grasp on vim already (sorry pros). This is targetted for the people who are happy using the mouse while programming or just want to get an idea of what using vim is like. I want to show you why using a mouse is inefficient and wastes so much time and effort. I am planning on showing the basic movements, various timesavers that can be done while programming, and generally show you why using vim is awesome. 

It helps to have ruby installed as that will be what our various sample files are in (if you plan on running them). Also, if this isn't already given you should install vim.
